Student
Software Engineering Project: Microsoft Kinect Game for Children with Autism
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
Jan 2012 – May 2012

My group made a modified version of the Hide and Seek game that would allow 
children to search for objects in a two-dimensional map by navigating only by 
pointing at the screen with their hands and fingers to indicate where they 
wanted to move and search. I handled the vast majority of the motion tracking 
code which locked onto the hands of players and allowed them to navigate 
through the map and search for hidden objects. I also implemented much of the
back end physics for our game which influenced factors such as character speed 
and the detection of found objects.

Undergraduate Researcher
UROP Project: Detecting & Attributing Climate Change
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
Sep 2010 - May 2011

Undergraduate researcher working under Dr. Natalia G Andronova of Atmospheric, 
Oceanic, and Space Sciences (AOSS). Extracted data of the variable net 
downward shortwave flux over both time and coordinate systems and compared it 
with the data obtained from the MERRA reanalysis program. Data was used to 
come to a decision for the optimal stations in the northeastern region of the 
U.S. to build solar batteries.
